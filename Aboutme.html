  <h2> About Me</h2>
  
  <p> My name is Ma'Niyha Miller and here you all will learn about me and what it is that I do. &nbsp; I am orginally from North Carolina but now I
  live in D.C. I attend Mckinley Technology H.S where I am a rising senior. I have had the opperunity to recieve an internship at Girls Who code where I have learned to code. At my school I am in digital media and that is basically where I use all the different types of Adobe to create different things like Logos, billboards, Menu's and diferent things as such. Being at Girls Who code I have had to step out of my comfort zone and learn all the different type sof coding. They were all difficul soome more so the others but in the end I have been able to master all that I can with an dwithout help.</p>
